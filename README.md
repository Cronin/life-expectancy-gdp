# life-expectancy-gdp
Codecademy project #2 during the Data Science Path

For this project, I analyze data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

During this project, I analyze, prepare, and plot data in order to answer questions in a meaningful way.
